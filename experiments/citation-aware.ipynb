Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language; possibilities include automatic translation of text from one language to another, or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand audio signals, with applications like speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically.

Computer vision faculty are developing novel approaches for 2D and 3D scene understanding from still images and video; joint understanding of images and language; low-shot learning (recognition of rare or previously unseen categories); transfer learning and domain adaptation (adapting pre-trained systems to a changing data distribution); and image generation and editing approaches based on generative neural networks. Natural language processing faculty are working on topics such as grounded language understanding, information extraction and text mining, and knowledge-driven natural language generation for applications such as scientific discovery. Machine listening faculty are working on sound and speech understanding, source separation, and enhancement, as well as applications in music and computing.

      "Sure! Here is the passage after removing unnecessary information:The study of systems that behave intelligently, artificial intelligence (AI) includes many key areas where our faculty are recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics. Computer vision systems can understand images and videos, such as building extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video or warning construction workers about nearby dangers. Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language, including automatic translation of text from one language to another or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand audio signals, such as speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically. Crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples to adjust systems to work as effectively as possible. Robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using machines that perceive and interact with the physical world.The AI group at Illinois is strong, diverse, and growing, combining expertise in core strengths with promising new research directions. In machine learning, AI group faculty are studying theoretical foundations of deep and reinforcement learning, developing novel models and algorithms for deep neural networks, federated, and distributed learning, as well as investigating issues related to scalability, security, privacy, and fairness of learning systems. Computer vision faculty are developing novel approaches for 2D and 3D scene understanding from still images and video, joint understanding of images and language, low-shot learning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation. Natural language processing faculty are working on topics such as grounded language understanding, information extraction and text mining, and knowledge-driven natural language generation. Machine listening faculty are working on sound and speech understanding, source separation, and enhancement, as well as applications in music and computing. Robotics faculty are developing novel planning algorithms for grasping, locomotion, and navigation, investigating multi-robot systems, and pursuing high-impact applications of robotics to medicine, agriculture, home care, and autonomous driving.\n",

      "The study of systems that behave intelligently, artificial intelligence (AI) includes many key areas where our faculty are recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics. Computer vision systems can understand images and videos, such as building extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video or warning construction workers about nearby dangers. Natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language, including automatic translation of text from one language to another or understanding text on Wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. Machine listening systems understand audio signals, such as speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or transcribing polyphonic music automatically. Crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples to adjust systems to work as effectively as possible. Robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using machines that perceive and interact with the physical world.\n",

      "The AI group at Illinois is strong, diverse, and growing, combining expertise in core strengths with promising new research directions. In machine learning, AI group faculty are studying theoretical foundations of deep and reinforcement learning, developing novel models and algorithms for deep neural networks, federated, and distributed learning, as well as investigating issues related to scalability, security, privacy, and fairness of learning systems. Computer vision faculty are developing novel approaches for 2D and 3D scene understanding from still images and video, joint understanding of images and language, low-shot learning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation. Natural language processing faculty are working on topics such as grounded language understanding, information extraction and text mining, and knowledge-driven natural language generation. Machine listening faculty are working on sound and speech understanding, source separation, and enhancement, as well as applications in music and computing. Robotics faculty are developing novel planning algorithms for grasping, locomotion, and navigation, investigating multi-robot systems, and pursuing high-impact applications of robotics to medicine, agriculture, home care, and autonomous driving.\"\n",
